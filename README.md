# AssignmentTracker

Simple app that allows the user to add a list of different courses with a list of assignments and sub-assignments and store them in a locally stored SQLite database. Also allows for backing up, importing and removing local SQLite instances.

Future ideas include importing all assignment due dates to Google Calendar (possibly an auto-sync feature?) and time analysis of each assignment.
